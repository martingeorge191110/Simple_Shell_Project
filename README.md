---> Project Description:

The hsh project involves creating a simple UNIX command language interpreter that can read and execute commands from a file or standard input.

---> How hsh Works:

 - Prompt and Input: hsh displays a prompt and waits for user input.
 - Process Handling: It spawns a child process to manage the command.
 - Command Execution: The interpreter checks for built-in commands, aliases in the PATH, and local executable  programs. The command, along with its arguments, replaces the child process.
 - Returning to Prompt: After the command execution, the program returns to the parent process and displays the prompt again, ready for a new command.
 - Exit Options: To exit, press Ctrl-D or type exit (with or without a status).
 - Non-Interactive Mode: The shell also supports non-interactive execution.
